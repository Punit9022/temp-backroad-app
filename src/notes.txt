strict mode is a tool for highlighting the potential problems in our application, it activates additional checks 
and warnings for its descendants
It only runs in the development, it will not going to affect the production build
In development it renders twice

app.css is not only going to stick to app.js 
The css file is not scoped by default to a certain component

Pretty much for every functionality I set it up in a different component in a different file

generally for the root component we create a new file and i.e App.js and we import this file in the index.js

<a href="#about" className="nav-link">
It will create a link, and if I click on this link it will take me to the element which is having the id about

We will host our project on netlify with some extra benefits

so firstly we need to remvove the existing git repository
rmdir -Force -Recurse .git

git init creates a empty git repository
git add . adds the entire project on the github repository
git commit -m "first commit" => a shortcut command that immediately creates a commit with a passed commit message

benefits of continous deployments:-
- don't need to keep project locally
- automatic builds
whenever we do some changes in our project and push it on github than netlify will automatically rebuild
our project

netlify treats warnings as errors

now we will be using vite to develop our react projects
In all the dev environments react code is same but the folders and the commands are different
